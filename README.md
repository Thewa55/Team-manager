I decided to add an Engineer next for example, you will be prompted to ask for some information on the Engineer:

I have an Accountant I would like to add so I input 2 on the prompt and after a few questions, my Accountant has been added to the team:

Lastly I have an intern I would like to add as well, after selecting intern and answering a few questions about the intern they've also been added to the team:

I added a few more team members and that is my whole team. At the user prompt I tell the program I am done adding members to my team and get a final print out of my team:
